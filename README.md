## 💻 Sobre o projeto

Layout developed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, without commercial purposes, just in order to practice my skills with the aforementioned stack. The design was created by Jahid Hasan which can be found on Dribbble via the link below.

The entire responsive part of the layout was designed and developed by myself. In addition, the carousels were implemented using the javascrit plugin <a href="https://glidejs.com/"> Glide.js</a> .
